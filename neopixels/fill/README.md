# Change number of glowing pixels with the potentiometer

**Goal:** This one is similar to the [cycle](../cycle) project,
but now the strip is filled:

* Potentiometer at 0/8 to 1/8: Pixel 1 is on
* Potentiometer at 1/8 to 2/8: Pixels 1 and 2 are on
* Potentiometer at 2/8 to 3/8: Pixels 1 to 3 are on
* Potentiometer at 3/8 to 4/8: Pixels 1 to 4 are on
* Potentiometer at 4/8 to 5/8: Pixels 1 to 5 are on
* Potentiometer at 5/8 to 6/8: Pixels 1 to 6 are on
* Potentiometer at 6/8 to 7/8: Pixels 1 to 7 are on
* Potentiometer at 7/8 to 8/8: Pixels 1 to 8 are on
