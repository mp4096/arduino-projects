# Change color with the potentiometer

**Goal:** Change color with the potentiometer, from red to green to blue and
then to red again.

**Hint:** You can use the `ColorHSV` function of the Arduino NeoPixel library
to choose the color. Remember that it takes a 16-bit integer (up to 65535),
so multiply the pot reading by 64.
