# Change brightness with the potentiometer

**Goal:** Change pixel with the potentiometer.

**Hint:** Somewhat ironically one should use the `setBrightness` function _only_ in setup!
It should not be used for animation or dynamical brightness adjustment.
Hence, the best solution here is to adjust the RGB values themselves.
