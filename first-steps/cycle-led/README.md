# Cycling through different LED blinking modes

**Goal:** Cycle LED blinking modes on keypress. Modes:

1. LED always on
2. LED blinks slowly (250 ms delay)
3. LED blinks quickly (100 ms delay)

**Hint:** Once again you will face contact bounce.
Sleep for 250 ms after entering the first mode to avoid skipping it entirely.
